## Code insertion

Similar to python block commenting; using \` instead of \'
\`\`\`
asdfasdf
\`\`\`
1 옆의 키(shift 누르면 물결표되는) 세번 따다닥
```
asdfasdf
```

Styling: python: (start with \`\`\`python)
```python
#! python3
import Gong4.py
thisJeongyeunyeon = 2017
print(hell o world!)
```
One line: \`python Gong4.py\` `python Gong4.py`

- level 1(- )
* also level 1(\* )
  * level 2: two spaces
  - also level 2
    * level 3: two more spaces
    - *\*italics*\*
    - -nothing happens-
    - **\*\*bold font\*\***
    - putting \ with special character(\* or \`)
      makes it lose its markdown function

## Little problems
- The contents are always aligned to center vertically
- Impossible to align image to right on this version
- No slide templates, only one theme(which I personally hate)
- 한글 되지만 글씨체가 좀 구림
- May look different from platform to platform, 
from computer to computer(different markdown renderers)

## Convenience
- You barely touch mouse
- Simple!
- Awesome productivity
- Cross-platform

---
Happy markdown!
